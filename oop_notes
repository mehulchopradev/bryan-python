Object Oriented Programming
- Have a mapping between real world semantics and software design

1. Visualize real world actors as data in the software
  - object
  - every object needs a data type : class
    - str, int, float, bool
    - Student, Professor
    - 1 to n objects are created from a class
2. Real world actor characteristics -> Attributes of the object
  - name, gender, roll, marks
  - every object will have its own set of attributes
  - grouped together inside an object
3. Real world actor actions -> Methods being called on the object
  - getGrade, getDetails
